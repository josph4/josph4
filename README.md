# Hello, World! 👋

My name is Jose and I'm based in Galicia, Spain. 
I graduated from University of A Coruña in Computer Engineering, I've worked as a Backend Developer for //ABANCA in the past and I'm looking for a Software Engineer role to get back to work again!

Despite my experience in the banking enviroment, I'm really eager to explore other areas (specially the space sector and research)

I'm always seeking to improve, learn and stay up to date with the latest technological advancements.
Apart from my career as a Software Engineer, I am also interested in other specific disciplines such as Game development, AI and LLMs.

### 🔭 I’m currently working on personal projects while I'm on my job hunting quest
