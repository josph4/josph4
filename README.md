# Hello, World! 👋

My name is Jose and I'm based in Galicia, Spain. 
I graduated from University of A Coruña in Computer Engineering, I've worked as a Backend Developer for //ABANCA in the past and I'm looking for a Software Engineer role to get back to work again!

Despite my experience in the banking enviroment, I'm really eager to explore other areas (specially the space sector)

### 🔭 I’m currently working on personal projects while I'm on my job hunting quest
